# Arduino-n-Motors

Welcome, in this repository there are two projects, where we use DC motor with the arduino and we use Servomotor in the other.

# Servomotor with arduino

Here we connected the servomotor to the arduino and we control the movement through the code

While here, we used a potentometer to control the servo's movement
