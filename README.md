# Arduino-n-Motors

Welcome, in this repository there are two projects, where we use DC motor with the arduino and we use Servomotor in the other.

# Servomotor with arduino

Here we connected the servomotor to the arduino and we control the movement through the code

and here's the ino file of it: [[Code/code contorl.ino]](https://github.com/oAmadu/Arduino-n-Motors/blob/e36e22c14b6869619f2100a0daff5d6896192c8e/Code/code%20contorl.ino)

While here, we used a potentometer to control the servo's movement
